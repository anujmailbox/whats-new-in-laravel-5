### Tuts+ Course: What's New in Laravel 5?

#### Instructor: Matthew Machuga

The newest release of Laravel has finally shipped!  Let's take a look at how L5's new features can save you development time, reduce boilerplate, and simplify your workflow.  We'll also take a look at what you need to change to move towards doing things the Laravel 5 way.

In this repository, you'll find a base Laravel 5 application.  To boot:

- Launch the web server via `php artisan serve`
- Run `cp .env.example .env` to setup the .env file
- Use `git branch` to fetch a list of all available branches
- Use `git checkout <tagname>` to checkout a branch at a given point in the app
